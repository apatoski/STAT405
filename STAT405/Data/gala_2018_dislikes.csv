1590599371,"Folks had mentioned that there would be music and dancing. We never saw or heard any. we did not get past the Mazda area and this is after getting there at 8 and never were exposed to live music or anything like that. Nor did we get to walk the whole stretch of the room. Moreover at an event where women would wear heels I don't think it was the best idea to have the same type of foods-- pork and the sandwiches all on one side of the room with one prime rib station on that side. The tacos and pasta were all the way on the other side and I almost didn't get to have any tacos because by the time I got to that side of the room it was almost 10 and they were wrapping that up. If detailed info was offered telling people what type of food was available where, I would have known to head in that direction instead of wasting my time with food that wasn't really what I would have wanted. Lots of eggplant and the sandwiches -- it was annoying walking from station to station on that side of the room and not seeing different food. There should have been more directions discussing what specific food was available wHere. Luckily a staff person told me, but as I walked and walked and didn't come across it and asked someone else she had no idea. The staff needed to be more knowledgeable. Also having the dessert on a separate floor, also a waste of time and inefficient. that is out of range for women in heels and also hard if you're still walking around trying to see the cars."
