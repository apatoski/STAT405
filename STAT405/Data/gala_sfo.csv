1590554889,That the Dub section has been closed off for a second year running. its been open in the past black tie events and i miss it.
1590566446,not much choice in the way of food
1590554046,"Not enough food, lines too long. Would have expected a nicer spread for the price of the tickets. Also, the champagne stopped being served early on in the evening which also was disturbing in relationship to the price of each ticket."
1590564474,Not a lot of younger crowd and did not know where high end cars like Bentley were at to view
1590550291,none

1590549434,nothing all good
1590563005,The desserts
1590565703,The long lines at the two dessert stations - more were needed.  Desserts on the upstairs club level would have help spread out the crowd.  The dessert layout had the cakes behind the gooey toppings making it a difficut reach in black tie attire.
1590563732,I ENJOYED EVERYTHING
1590564938,The lack of and design/ layout of the dessert stations.
1590556041,"Very little food for the volume of people, many food stations were cleaned out, line for dessert was probably 100 people long and then there was no dessert left and lines for bar were 20+ people long"
1590548022,NOTHING
1590557056,The food was poor this year and was great in the past.  Long lines everywhere.  Dessert was awful.
1590567154,food was not that good and you could barely hear the music
1590552776,Long line for desert. Could not get desert. The coffee was empty except for decaf. Disappointed in the food. The food was mediocre. I have had the opportunity to eat at his resturants on many occasions and this was not his best work. Previous years the food was fantastic. This year was fair with minimal selection

1590566479,Lack of information at the event on the order of events
1590559128,Getting Food and Drink was WAY to long of a wait.  The catering staf was overwhelmed.  More stations and/or butlers with appettizers would be better.

1590547909,Paying to park

1590563047,The Set up of the cars and food stations
1590553295,The Grand Halls distance form the rest of the floor.
1590556744,"the food. NO MORE wooden forks for the salads. I couldn't even enjoyed the salad. The lines for the desserts was EXTREMELY long. I think the desserts needs to be in the main room along with the food. I missed the ice cream sundaes. I think the meat (beef) needs to be pre-cut and placed on a plate for us to get. Some should be well done, some show be medium. The best was the nachos chips."
1590556892,"lack of concept cars. the C7 vette, the acura NSX"
1590562965,Food choices limited
